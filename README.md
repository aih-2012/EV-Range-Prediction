## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a predictive model for estimating the range of electric vehicles.  
It can help users, manufacturers, and enthusiasts **estimate the driving distance** of an EV under different conditions.

---

## Dataset
- Title: `Electric Vehicle Specs Dataset (2025)`
- Author: `Urvish Ahir`
- Link: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/urvishahir/electric-vehicle-specifications-dataset-2025`
- Number of entries: `1000`
- Columns include `[Battery Capacity, Motor Power, Drivetrain, Efficiency, etc.]`

---

## Features
The model uses the following features to predict EV range:
- Top Speed (Kmh)
- Battery Capacity (kWh)
- Number of cells
- Torque (nM)
- Acceleration (0-100, s)
- Fast charging Power (kW/dc)
- Towing capacity (kg)
- Motor Power (kW)
- Cargo Volume (L)
- Drivetrain (FWD/RWD/AWD)
- Segment
- Body type
- Vehicle Weight (kg)
- Efficiency (Wh/km)

---

## Model
- Model type: `Random Forest`
- Programming language: Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `[Optional: matplotlib, seaborn]`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ev-range-predictor.git
```

2. Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the prediction script:
```
python predict_range.py
```

4. Input vehicle parameters and get the predicted range.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using standard regression metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): [14.125]
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): [Insert value]
- RÂ² Score: [Insert value]

### Example Code Snippet
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```
# Future Work
- Include more features such as driving conditions, temperature, and load.
- Improve model accuracy using advanced algorithms or neural networks.
- Deploy as a web app or mobile app for interactive predictions.
