## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a predictive model for estimating the range of electric vehicles.  
It can help users, manufacturers, and enthusiasts **estimate the driving distance** of an EV under different conditions.

---

## Dataset
- Source: `[Insert dataset source, e.g., Kaggle / CSV file / government dataset]`
- Number of entries: `[Insert number]`
- Columns include `[Battery Capacity, Motor Power, Vehicle Weight, Efficiency, etc.]`

---

## Features
The model uses the following features to predict EV range:
- Battery Capacity (kWh)
- Motor Power (kW)
- Vehicle Weight (kg)
- Aerodynamics / Drag Coefficient `[Optional]`
- Efficiency (Wh/km) `[Optional]`
- `[Add any additional features used]`

---

## Model
- Model type: `[Linear Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost / Neural Network]`
- Programming language: Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `[Optional: matplotlib, seaborn]`

### Example Code Snippet
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```
